abstract: Aging and lifespan development researchers have been fortunate to have public
  access to many longitudinal datasets. These data are valuable and see high utilization,
  yet this has a considerable downside. Many of these are heavily overused. Overuse
  of publicly available datasets creates dependency among published research papers
  giving the false impression of independent contributions to knowledge by reporting
  the same associations over multiple papers. This is a potentially serious problem
  in the aging literature given the high use of a relatively small number of well-known
  studies. Any irregularities or sampling biases in this relatively small number of
  samples have outsize influence on perceived answers to key aging questions. We detail
  this problem, focusing on issues of dependency among studies, sampling bias and
  overfitting, and contradictory estimates of the same effect from the same data in
  independent publications. We provide solutions, including greater use of data sharing,
  pre-registrations, holdout samples, split-sample cross-validation, and coordinated
  analysis. We argue these valuable datasets are public resources that are being diminished
  by overuse, with parallels in environmental science. Taking a conservation perspective,
  we hold that these practices (pre-registration, holdout samples) can preserve data
  resources for future generations of researchers. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022
