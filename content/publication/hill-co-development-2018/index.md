abstract: |
  The current study examined whether relationships also influence personality trait development during
  middle and older adulthood, focusing on the individual's perception of support from the relationship
  partner. Using data from the Health and Retirement Study (n = 20,422; mean age = 65.9 years), we
  examined the longitudinal relationships between Big Five personality trait levels and perceived
  support from children, family, friends, and spouses.
