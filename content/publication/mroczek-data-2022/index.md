abstract: |
  Aging and lifespan development researchers have been fortunate to have public access to many
  longitudinal datasets. These data are valuable and see high utilization, yet this has a considerable
  downside. Many of these are heavily overused. Overuse of publicly available datasets creates
  dependency among published research papers giving the false impression of independent contributions
  to knowledge by reporting the same associations over multiple papers.
