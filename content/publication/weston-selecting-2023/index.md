abstract: Topic modeling is a type of text analysis that identifies clusters of co-occurring
  words, or latent topics. A challenging step of topic modeling is determining the
  number of topics to extract. This tutorial describes tools researchers can use to
  identify the number and labels of topics in topic modeling. First, we outline the
  procedure for narrowing down a large range of models to a select number of candidate
  models. This procedure involves comparing the large set on fit metrics, including
  exclusivity, residuals, variational lower bound, and semantic coherence. Next, we
  describe the comparison of a small number of models using project goals as a guide
  and information about topic representative and solution congruence. Finally, we
  describe tools for labeling topics, including frequent and exclusive words, key
  examples, and correlations among topics.
