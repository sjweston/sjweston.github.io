 abstract = {Personality traits are known predictors of health behaviors and health status. However, most of this work focuses exclusively on how personality inﬂuences health outcomes rather than how personality inﬂuences response to disease. Using a large, national study (N = 7051), we investigated whether conscientiousness and neuroticism were associated with smoking behavior after the onset of a disease. After the onset of a major chronic disease, high levels of neuroticism predicted less smoking when paired with high levels of conscientiousness, a combination described as healthy neuroticism. Healthy neuroticism only predicted smoking behavior after the onset of disease, not before, suggesting that the relationship between personality and responses to health problems differs from the relationship between personality and the onset of health problems.},
