I developed an introduction to Bayesian Analysis seminar in the spring term of 2025. The course covers foundational concepts in Bayesian inference, practical implementation using R and Stan, and applications to real research problems.

**Topics include:**
- Bayesian foundations and prior specification
- Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods
- Model comparison and selection
- Hierarchical models
- Practical applications in psychological research
