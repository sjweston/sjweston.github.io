abstract: The inclusion of psychosocial variables into electronic health records provides
  a unique opportunity for the translation of findings from social, psychological,
  and behavioral domains into patient care. This commentary is a response to the recommendations
  of a committee convened by the Institute of Medicine to address this opportunity
  (Matthews, Adler, Forrest, & Stead, 2016). We concur with the committee that the
  inclusion of psychosocial variables in electronic health records will broadly benefit
  researchers, practitioners, and patients and that there is clear need for a recommended
  panel of psychosocial measures that is ready for implementation in clinical settings.
  In fact, it seems likely that these recommendations will have lasting consequences.
  Given this, our response highlights several concerns about the recommendations and
  criteria. We suggest further clarification of the audience for these recommendations,
  reconsideration of the overly restrictive inclusion criteria, and more extensive
  engagement of psychosocial researchers to achieve broader consensus.
