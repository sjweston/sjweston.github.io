abstract: |
  The classic Aesop's fable, Crow and the Pitcher, has inspired a major line of research in comparative
  cognition. Over the past several years, five articles (over 32 experiments) have examined the ability
  of corvids to complete lab-based analogs of this fable. These researchers have stressed the unique
  potential of this paradigm for understanding causal reasoning in corvids.
