abstract: 'The theory of healthy neuroticism, that neuroticism can impact health through
  both negative and positive pathways, often relies on descriptions of vigilance to
  illustrate beneficial effects. The current study is among the first to describe
  the relationship of neuroticism to body vigilance and test the degree to which this
  relationship impacts health. In an online participant panel (N = 1055), neuroticism
  was associated with one factor of vigilance: sensation awareness belief. This factor
  had a suppression effect on the relationship between neuroticism and healthy behavior,
  such that the effect of neuroticism through vigilance was healthy, whereas the direct
  effect was unhealthy. We discuss the implications of these findings and caution
  against using vigilance to explain the heterogeneity in neuroticism-health relationships.'
