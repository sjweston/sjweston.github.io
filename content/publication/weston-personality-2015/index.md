abstract: While personality traits have been linked concurrently to health status
  and prospectively to outcomes such as mortality, it is currently unknown whether
  traits predict the diagnosis of a number of specific diseases (e.g., lung disease,
  heart disease, and stroke) that may account for their mortality effects more generally.
  A sample (N ¼ 6,904) of participants from the Health and Retirement Study, a longitudinal
  study of older adults, completed personality measures and reported on current health
  conditions. Four years later, participants were followed up to see if they developed
  a new disease. Initial cross-sectional analyses replicated past findings that personality
  traits differ across disease groups. Longitudinal logistic regression analyses predicting
  new disease diagnosis suggest that traits are associated with the risk of developing
  disease—most notably the traits of conscientiousness, neuroticism, and openness.
  Findings are discussed as a means to identify pathways between personality and health.
