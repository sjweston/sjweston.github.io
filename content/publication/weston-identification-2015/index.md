abstract: Personality traits are known predictors of health behaviors and health status.
  However, most of this work focuses exclusively on how personality inﬂuences health
  outcomes rather than how personality inﬂuences response to disease. Using a large,
  national study (N = 7051), we investigated whether conscientiousness and neuroticism
  were associated with smoking behavior after the onset of a disease. After the onset
  of a major chronic disease, high levels of neuroticism predicted less smoking when
  paired with high levels of conscientiousness, a combination described as healthy
  neuroticism. Healthy neuroticism only predicted smoking behavior after the onset
  of disease, not before, suggesting that the relationship between personality and
  responses to health problems differs from the relationship between personality and
  the onset of health problems.
