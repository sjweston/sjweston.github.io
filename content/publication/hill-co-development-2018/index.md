abstract: The current study examined whether relationships also influence personality
  trait development during middle and older adulthood, focusing on the individualâ€™s
  perception of support from the relationship partner. Using data from the Health
  and Retirement Study (n = 20,422; mean age = 65.9 years), we examined the longitudinal
  relationships between Big Five personality trait levels and perceived support from
  children, family, friends, and spouses. Results found that participants who reported
  more positive social support and lower negative support also tended to score higher
  on conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and openness to experience, but
  lower on neuroticism. Moreover, changes in positive support across relationship
  partners coincided with trait changes over time, in the form of more positive support
  was associated with seemingly adaptive changes on the Big Five. Findings are discussed
  with respect to identifying social influences on personality development in adulthood.
