abstract: Numerous studies that link personality traits with health status, sometimes
  decades in the future, providing a strong claim for personality traits to causally
  influence physical health. While the prevailing consensus is that personality traits
  influence health through intermediary processes like health behaviors, less discussed
  is the possibility that health status influences personality. In this chapter, we
  describe the existing evidence that health is associated with changes in personality
  and discuss the potential mechanisms that relate the two.
