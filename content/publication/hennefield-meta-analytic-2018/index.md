abstract: 'The classic Aesop’s fable, Crow and the Pitcher, has inspired a major line
  of research in comparative cognition. Over the past several years, five articles
  (over 32 experiments) have examined the ability of corvids (e.g., rooks, crows,
  and jays) to complete lab-based analogs of this fable, by requiring them to drop
  stones and other objects into tubes of water to retrieve a floating worm (Bird and
  Emery in Curr Biol 19:1–5, ; Cheke et al. in Anim Cogn 14:441–455, ; Jelbert et
  al. in PLoS One 3:e92895, ; Logan et al. in PLoS One 7:e103049, ; Taylor et al.
  in Gray R D 12:e26887, ). These researchers have stressed the unique potential of
  this paradigm for understanding causal reasoning in corvids. Ghirlanda and Lind
  (Anim Behav 123:239–247, ) re-evaluated trial-level data from these studies and
  concluded that initial preferences for functional objects, combined with trial-and-error
  learning, may account for subjects’ performance on key variants of the paradigm.
  In the present paper, we use meta-analytic techniques to provide more precise information
  about the rate and mode of learning that occurs within and across tasks. Within
  tasks, subjects learned from successful (but not unsuccessful) actions, indicating
  that higher-order reasoning about phenomena such as mass, volume, and displacement
  is unlikely to be involved. Lurthermore, subjects did not transfer information learned
  in one task to subsequent tasks, suggesting that corvids do not engage with these
  tasks as variants of the same problem (i.e., how to generate water displacement
  to retrieve a floating worm). Our methodological analysis and empirical findings
  raise the question: Can Aesop’s fable studies distinguish between trial-and-error
  learning and/or higher-order causal reasoning? We conclude they cannot.'
