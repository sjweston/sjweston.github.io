abstract: 'Objective: The present research examined the effects of the social environment
  on the onset of specific health ailments. Design: Using data from the Health and
  Retirement Study, we examined participantsâ€™ responses to social environment questions
  in 2006 as predictors of onset of different health conditions over the next four
  years.Main Outcome Measures: Healthy participants (n = 7514) reported on their number
  of social partners, interaction frequency, positive social support and negative
  social support with respect to both their family and friends. These variables were
  used to predict onset of seven conditions in 2010: high blood pressure, heart condition,
  lung disease, cancer, stroke, diabetes and arthritis.Results: Logistic regressions
  indicated that the social environment provided some predictive value for onset of
  most health outcomes, with more positive and less negative social support appearing
  to buffer against onset. Social environmental variables related to friendships appeared
  to play a greater role than the family indicators. However, no variable proved universally
  adaptive, and social indicators had little value in predicting onset of chronic
  conditions.Conclusion: The current findings point to the potential for the social
  environment to influence later health, while demonstrating the nuanced role that
  our social lives play with respect to health.'
